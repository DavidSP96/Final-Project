# Final Project


<!--
DH general comments: 
- The project organization is more confusing the helpful:  This readme is basically empty; there's a folder called readme that seems to contain an analysis script; what looks like another analysis script in a different folder; an an Rproj file in a folder by itself. 

- An EDA should have a narrative structure: here's our research question, here's the data, here's what's in it, here's how it answers our question.  Think of it as a little tour of the data.
